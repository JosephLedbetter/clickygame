<h1>Puppy Love!<h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Puppy live is an application where users click images of puppies in order to earn points. You win the game whenever you have clicked all 9 of the puppies, without clicking the same one twice. The only catch is that the puppies move in their location with every click... </li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies used in the project:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>Bootstrap-</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code</h2>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>First thing was to create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app 'clickygame'.  After 'cd clickygame' to navigate into folder. Lastly typing yarn start to open the app in the browser.</p>
<h4>Starting to Code</h4>
<p>After altering two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory. I felt using three components for the app..</p>
<h4>Pieces</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Card
      <p>The card component is where all puppy images are displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Score
    <p>The score component displays the score.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Wrapper
    <p>The Wrapper component wraps includes the entire card component.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I opted for no separate header component.</p>
